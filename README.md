2. Rules of Reac-Jack

******************************************************************************

2.1 The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
2.2 Face cards are worth 10, and Aces are worth 11. This is unlike classic blackjack, where Aces are worth either 11 or 1. Watch out for this.
2.3 Each player starts with two cards, and one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
2.4 To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
2.5 If you go over 21, you go bust (lose), and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
2.6 If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack. If you hit 21 at all before it is the dealer's turn, you still get a blackajack (unlike in classic blackjack).
2.7 A blackjack means you win what you bet, plus 50%.
2.8 For example, if you bet $10, and get a blackjack, you will get a total of $25 (the $10 you bet, plus another $10 for winning, plus 50% of $10 (which is $5) for a total of $25).
2.9. The dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
2.10 There is no 'doubling down' in Reac-Jack (unlike classic blackjack).
2.11 There is no splitting cards in Reac-Jack (unlike classic blackjack).
